AIM:- Configure NTP Server (NTPd), Install and Configure NTPd, Configure NTP client
(Ubuntu and Windows) Network Time Protocol(NTP) has unique ability for companies to
synchronize the clocks of all the systems within the company. Solution:- →Time Synchronisation
NTP is a TCP/IP protocol for synchronizing time over a network. Basically a client requests the
current time from a server, and uses it to set its own clock. →Install NTPd and Configure NTP server for time adjustment. NTP uses 123/UDP.Install and
Configure NTPd.
→Type nano /etc/ntp.conf and make changes in /etc/ntp.conf
# line 18: comment out and
# add servers of your timezone for time synchronization

o The nomodify options prevents any changes to the configuration. o The notrap option prevents ntpdc control message protocol traps. o The nopeer option prevents a peer association being formed. o The noquery option prevents ntpq and ntpdc queries, but not time queries, from being
answered. ➔ systemctl restart ntp
➔ systemctl status ntp
➔ ntpq –p
→Configure NTP Client : Windows – Open [control panel] – [Clock and Region]--- [Date and Time ] and move to [internet time] tab, then [change
settings] button.
Type above address in server tab
Successful msg will shown if time sync without error
now restart ntp show status
systemctl restart ntp
ntpq -p
REFID=the current source of synchronization for the remote host
STRATUM=the stratum level of the remote host
T=types available
l local (such as a GPS clock)
u unicast (this is the common type)
m multicast
b broadcast - netaddr (usually 0)
WHEN=number of seconds passed since the remote host response
POLL=polling interval to the remote host, defined with the "minpoll" value in ntp.conf file
REACH=indicates how successful attempts to reach the server are. This is an 8-bit shift register
with the most recent probe in the 2^0 position. The value 001 indicates the most recent probe
was answered, while 357 indicates one probe was not answered. The value 377 indicates that all
the recent probes have been answered. DELAY= (round trip time) indicates the time (in milliseconds) taken by the reply packet to
return in response to a query sent by the server. OFFSET=indicates the time difference (in milliseconds) between the server's clock and the
client's clock. When this number exceeds 128, and the message synchronization lost appears in
the log file
DISP=indicates the difference in the offset measurement between two samples. This is an error- bound estimate. The dispersion is a primary measure of the network service quality. Jitter: “This number is an absolute value in milliseconds, showing the root mean squared
deviation of your offsets.”
