Practical No 7
Aim:
Install MySQL to configure database server, Install phpMyAdmin to operate MySQL
on a web browser from Clients. Solution: done from “compile lsa 22-23” and sybal ma'am journal without get-text(also can’t
login in phpmyadmin website)
Solution:
Step 1: Update all the repository and install mysql-server
Step 2: Restart sql and check status. After status is active enable mysql
systemctl restart mysql
systemctl status mysql
systemctl enable mysql
Step 3: We will use secure_installation to configure mysql and make it more secure. Do yes in all the option for better security
Step 4: Go inside mysql and check some commands. mysql -u root -p;
show databases;
create database exampleDB;
Enable user for weblogin
Create new user for weblogin and grant permission for localhost
Mysql listen on port 3306 and we will allow to listen this port from anywhere in browser
Also note the change in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
If bind-address = 127.0.0.1 then it will only listen to localhost
If bind-address = 0.0.0.0 then it will from every host
If bind-address = 192.168.152.129(i.e. Your ubuntu system address) then it will only listen to
your ip address. Note: No need to change anything , this information is only for general knowledge
Step 5: Check status of mysql port with netstat -ntulp command. If netstat is not install then
install it form apt-get install net-tools. You can see mysql is listening to port 3306
Step 6: Install php and phpmyadmin
apt install php
apt install phpmyadmin
Step 7: Type ifconfig and note the address and open browser and login to website
192.168.244.132/phpmyadmin
Step 8: Click on exampleDB and write table name and then click go
Click on preview SQL to see command for above query
\
You can check student table
