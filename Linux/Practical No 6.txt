Practical No 6
Aim:
Configure NFS server to share directories on your NFS, Configure NFS Client. (Ubuntu and Windows Client OS)
Solution:
Step 1: Install nfs server “apt install nfs-kernel-server”
Step 2: Change in /etc/idmapd.conf . Also give 777 permission to this file
Add “Pipefs-Directory = /run/rpc_pipefs” and “Domain = srv.world”
Step 3: Change in /etc/exports and add “/home/faraz
192.168.152.129(rw,sync,no_root_squash,subtree_check)”. Format to this is “/path/to/nfs/share
server_ip(rw,sync,no_root_squash,subtree_check)” Address is the same as marked in the image below. Type ifconfig to see address
Step 4: Restart and check status of server
systemctl restart nfs-server
systemctl status nfs-server
Step 5: Install nfs client, “apt install nfs-common”
Step 6: Create the mount point directory and add directory name in /etc/fstab file. My mount
point directory name is “/mnt/nfs12” and location for mount point directory is “/home/faraz”
.Add “192.168.152.129:/home/faraz /mnt/nfs12 nfs rw,soft,intr,noatime,x-gvfs-show” in
/etc/fstab file
Step 7:
● mount -a
● mount -t nfs 192.168.152.129:/home/faraz /mnt/nfs12
● df -hT
Step 8: You can see the folder of nfs in your PC
